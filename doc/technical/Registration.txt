CCNx Face Management and Registration Protocol
==============================================


== Face Management Protocol
The Face Management Protocol provides a method for an entity such as ccndc to control
the faces maintained by ccnd, which are subsequently used in the Registration Protocol.

The FMP supports "newface", "destroyface", and "queryface" operations.

A request operation is represented as a CCNx Interest with
a CCNx ContentObject encoding the majority of the request parameters embedded
as a component of the Interest name.
A response is represented as a ContentObject for which the name matches the Interest,
and the content encodes any necessary response data.

For the Face Management Protocol, the CCNx ContentObject encoding the request and reply
is the FaceInstance.

To create a new face ccndc signs a content object NFBLOB whose Content is a
ccnb-encoded FaceInstance containing

  - Action "newface"
  - other fields necessary to set up a socket (at least IPProto, Host, and Port).

ccndc then expresses an interest in /ccnx/CCNDID/newface/NFBLOB

  - CCNDID is the pubid of the local ccnd
  - NFBLOB is the signed content object

The verb, "newface" occurs redundantly in both the interest prefix and in the NFBLOB.
Its presence in the prefix is for dispatching the request.
It is also in the NFBLOB, so that it is signed.

ccnd creates the new face and answers with a FaceInstance containing
at least the PublisherPublicKeyDigest and FaceID.

== FaceInstance
See ccnx.xsd/ccnx.dtd

.......................................................
FaceInstance ::= Action?
	         PublisherPublicKeyDigest?
		 FaceID?
		 IPProto?
		 Host?
		 Port?
		 MulticastInterface?
		 MulticastTTL?
		 FreshnessSeconds?

Action		 ::= ("newface" | "destroyface" | "queryface")
PublisherPublicKeyDigest ::= SHA-256 digest
FaceID 		 ::= nonNegativeInteger
IPProto 	 ::= nonNegativeInteger [IANA protocol number; 6=TCP, 17=UDP]
Host 		 ::= textual representation of numeric IPv4 or IPv6 address
Port 		 ::= nonNegativeInteger [1..65535]
MulticastInterface ::= textual representation of numeric IPv4 or IPv6 address
MulticastTTL 	 ::= nonNegativeInteger [1..255]
FreshnessSeconds ::= nonNegativeInteger
.......................................................

=== Action
When FaceInstance is used as a request, the Action must be specified.
It will not be present in a response.

. `newface` - If a face matching the parameters does not already exist, 
   an attempt is made to create it.
   Then if the face exists (whether new or old)
   the full description is returned as a FaceInstance.
. `destroyface` - at least the FaceID must be present.
   If permitted, the face is destroyed.
. `queryface` - specification TBD

=== PublisherPublicKeyDigest
Identifies the ccnd that the information is relevant for.
PublisherPublicKeyDigest is not necessary for self-registration, but
indicates the ccnd to which the request is directed, if present.
PublisherPublicKeyDigest is always present in a response.

=== FaceID
FaceID is not present in a `newface` request, but must be specified in
a `destroyface` or `queryface` request.
FaceID is always present in a response.

=== Host
Identifies the IPv4 or IPv6 numeric address of the remote ccnd for this
FaceInstance.

=== Port
Port identifies the port on the remote ccnd, or the port for the multicast group.

=== MulticastInterface
If the Host is a multicast address, and there are multiple
interfaces present, MulticastInterface will identify the unicast
numeric address of the interface to which the multicast address will be
attached.

=== MulticastTTL
Specifies the TTL to be used for multicast operations.  The default value is 1.

=== FreshnessSeconds
FreshnessSeconds is optional in a request, but is treated as a hint by ccnd.
In a response, FreshnessSeconds specifies the remaining lifetime of the
face.

== Prefix Registration Protocol
The prefix registration protocol uses the ForwardingEntry element type
to represent both requests and responses.
.......................................................
ForwardingEntry ::= Action?
	            Name?
	            PublisherPublicKeyDigest?
		    FaceID?
		   ForwardingFlags?
		   FreshnessSeconds?

Action		 ::= ("prefixreg" | "selfreg" | "unreg")
Name		 ::= the name prefix to be registered
PublisherPublicKeyDigest ::= SHA-256 digest of the ccnd's public key (CCNDID)
FaceID 		 ::= nonNegativeInteger
ForwardingFlags  ::= nonNegativeInteger
FreshnessSeconds ::= nonNegativeInteger
.......................................................

=== Action
When ForwardingEntry is used as a request, the Action must be specified.
It will not be present in a response.

- `prefixreg` - Register (or re-register) the prefix on the specified face.
- `selfreg` - Register (or re-register) the prefix on the current face; the
  FaceID need not be present in the request, but if present it must match
  the current face.
- `unreg` - Remove the prefix registration for the specified face.

=== PublisherPublicKeyDigest
Identifies the ccnd that the information is relevant for.
It is optional in a request (the name in the requesting interest has
already addressed the appropriate node).
PublisherPublicKeyDigest is always present in a response.

=== FaceID
FaceID is required in `prefixreg` and `unreg` requests.
FaceID is always present in a response.

=== Name
This is the name prefix to be acted on.

=== ForwardingFlags
This integer holds the inclusive OR of the following bit fields:
.........................
CCN_FORW_ACTIVE         1
CCN_FORW_CHILD_INHERIT  2
CCN_FORW_ADVERTISE      4
CCN_FORW_LAST           8
CCN_FORW_CAPTURE       16
CCN_FORW_LOCAL         32
CCN_FORW_TAP           64
CCN_FORW_CAPTURE_OK   128
.........................
The `CCN_FORW_ACTIVE` bit indicates that the entry is active;
interests will not be sent for inactive entries (but see note below).

`CCN_FORW_CHILD_INHERIT` says that this entry may be used even if there is a
longer match available.
In the absence of this bit, the presence of a longer matching prefix that
has an active entry will prevent this entry from being used.

`CCN_FORW_ADVERTISE` says that the prefix may be advertised to other nodes.

`CCN_FORW_LAST` indicates that this entry should be used last, if nothing else
worked.
This is intended to be used by ccndc and similar programs to monitor
unanswered interests.
The presence of this flag on any entry causes the associated face to be considered non-local, as far as interest forwarding is concerned.
Thus it will not receive interests with Scope=1, nor will it receive interests in namespaces that are marked local.
However, the ability of the face to change prefix registrations is not affected.

`CCN_FORW_CAPTURE` says that no shorter prefix may be used, overriding
child-inherit bits that would otherwise make the shorter entries usable.
For a child-inherit bit to be overridden, the CCN_FORW_CAPTURE_OK must be set
in the same forwarding entry that has CCN_FORW_CHILD_INHERIT set.
Note that this means that using CCN_FORW_CAPTURE will have no effect if the
CCN_FORW_CAPTURE_OK flag is not used.

`CCN_FORW_LOCAL` restricts the namespace to use by applications on the local
machine.

`CCN_FORW_TAP` causes the entry to be used right away.  This is intended for debugging and monitoring purposes.  It is likely that there will be no response as a result, so no intentional delay is added before any further forwarding of this interest.

`CCN_FORW_CAPTURE_OK' used in conjunction with CCN_FORW_CHILD_INHERIT allows a
CCN_FORW_CAPTURE flag on a longer prefix to override the effect of the child-inherit bit.

The flags `CCN_FORW_ADVERTISE`, `CCN_FORW_CAPTURE` and `CCN_FORW_LOCAL` affect
the prefix as a whole, rather than the individual registrations.
Their effects take place whether or not the `CCN_FORW_ACTIVE` bit is set.

=== FreshnessSeconds
FreshnessSeconds is optional in a request, but is treated as a hint by ccnd.
In a response, FreshnessSeconds specifies the remaining lifetime of the
registration.
