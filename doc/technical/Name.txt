CCNx Name

Name ::= Component*
Component ::= BLOB
.......................................................
A Name element represents a hierarchical name for CCNx content.
It simply contains a sequence of *Component* elements.
Each Component element contains a sequence of zero or more bytes.
There are no restrictions on what byte sequences may be used.

The Name element in an *Interest* is often referred to with the
term 'name prefix' or simply 'prefix'.

=== URI Representation
It is often convenient to use a link:URI.html[URI Representation] for a CCNx Name.

=== XML Presentation
There are no restrictions on what byte sequences may be used in a Component,
so when displayed as XML, a base64Binary or hexBinary encoding may be
needed.
When the bytes happen to be printable UTF-8, a more human-friendly "text"
alternative is available.
(Note that the text and hexBinary options are not currently not shown in the link:xsd.html[official schema].)

=== Related
The Name element plays a pivotal role in both the
link:InterestMessage.html[Interest] and
link:ContentObject.html[ContentObject] element.  See the link:InterestMessage.html#example[Interest Message Example] for an example of encodings of a CCNx Name.
