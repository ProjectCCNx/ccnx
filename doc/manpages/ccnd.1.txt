CCND(1)
=======

NAME
----
ccnd - CCNx Daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnd* [-h]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ccnd* is not normally executed directly. Use *ccndstart(1)* to run an
instance of ccnd. *ccnd* normally runs indefinitely.  Use
*ccndsmoketest(1)* to terminate a *ccnd* (or use *kill(1)*).

*ccnd* is the software forwarder/router for CCNx and is required for
normal CCNx protocol communication.  The typical configuration is to
run one *ccnd* on each host; applications running on the host will
communicate through the local *ccnd*, and it will communicate over
attached networks (directly or through a link adapter process).

*ccnd* takes no options on the command-line. Basic options are controlled
by environment variables. The forwarding table (FIB) is populated with
registration protocols over CCNx.  Use *ccndc(1)* for configuring the
FIB.

*ccnd* communicates via the CCNx protocol running over UDP, TCP, or
Unix domain sockets (the latter for local processes only). It also
provides a simple web status view over HTTP, on the `CCN_LOCAL_PORT`.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
	Print a usage message describing environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

Options for *ccnd* are set via environment variables. 

    CCND_DEBUG=
      0 - no messages
      1 - basic messages (any non-zero value gets these)
      2 - interest messages
      4 - content messages
      8 - matching details
      16 - interest details
      32 - gory interest details
      64 - log occasional human-readable timestamps
      128 - face registration debugging
      bitwise OR these together for combinations; -1 gets max logging
    CCN_LOCAL_PORT=
      UDP port for unicast clients (default 9695).
      Also listens on this TCP port for stream connections.
      Also affects name of unix-domain socket.
    CCN_LOCAL_SOCKNAME=
      Name stem of unix-domain socket (default /tmp/.ccnd.sock).
    CCND_CAP=
      Capacity limit, in count of ContentObjects.
      Not an absolute limit.
    CCND_MTU=
      Packet size in bytes.
      If set, interest stuffing is allowed within this budget.
      Single items larger than this are not precluded.
    CCND_DATA_PAUSE_MICROSEC=
      Adjusts content-send delay time for multicast and udplink faces
    CCND_DEFAULT_TIME_TO_STALE=
      Default for content objects without explicit FreshnessSeconds,
      in seconds.  Must be positive.
    CCND_MAX_TIME_TO_STALE=
      Limit, in seconds, until content becomes stale.  Must be positive.
      If necessary, this will be reduced to the largest value
      that the implemementation can enforce.
    CCND_KEYSTORE_DIRECTORY=
      Directory readable only by ccnd where its keystores are kept
      Defaults to a private subdirectory of /var/tmp
    CCND_LISTEN_ON=
      List of ip addresses to listen on; defaults to wildcard. The
      addresses may be enclosed in square brackets.  The list elements
      are separated by whitespace, commas, or semicolons.  Both IPv4 and
      IPv6 addresses may be used.  Set this if you want to limit
      connectivity to a particular set of configured addresses.
      The most useful non-default setting is probably "localhost".
      Note that outgoing tcp connections may still be made.
    CCND_AUTOREG=
      List of prefixes to auto-register on new faces initiated by peers.
      The prefixes are represented as ccnx URIs, and
      are separated by whitespace, commas, or semicolons.
      If this is specified, the ccnd can be used as a "hub" to forward
      interests matching these prefixes to any peer that talks to it.
      example: CCND_AUTOREG=ccnx:/ccnx.org/Users,ccnx:/ccnx.org/Chat


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error)
