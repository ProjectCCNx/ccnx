CCNDSMOKETEST(1)
================

NAME
----
ccndsmoketest - Simple program for smoke-test of ccnd.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccndsmoketest* [-b] [-t 'msec'] [ (-T | -u) 'hostname' ] ( send 'filename' | 'sendfilename'.ccnb | recv | kill | status [-x] | timeo 'msec' ) '...'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccndsmoketest* is a simple program for sending and receiving data on sockets, for the purpose of testing ccnd.

Most of what this program does could be done with *nc*(1) (aka netcat).
It intentionally understands almost nothing about CCNx protocols.


OPTIONS
-------
*-b*::
	Binary output on stdout instead of the default hex.

*-t* 'milliseconds'::
	Set the timeout for recv commands (default is 1000, or 1 second).

*-T* 'hostname'::
	Contact the ccnd on the named host via TCP instead of the default unix-domain socket.

*-u* 'hostname'::
	Contact the ccnd on the named host via UDP instead of the default unix-domain socket.

*-x*::
	Use in conjunction with status command, returns XML output on stdout

ARGUMENTS
---------
The remaining arguments are processed in order.

*send* 'filename'::
	Send the contents of the named file.
	Use '-' to read from stdin.

*sendfilename*.ccnb::
	If the file extension is *.ccnb*, the *send* verb may be omitted.

*recv*::
	Recv one chunk (packet) and write the result to stdout (hex by default, but see -b).
	Times out with a message to stderr if nothing is received.

*kill*::
	Shuts down ccnd cleanly.

*status*::
	Used to implement *ccndstatus*(1).  Pass optional [-x] argument to request XML output.
    See link:../technical/CCNDStatus.html[CCND Status XML documentation] for more details.

*timeo* 'milliseconds'::
	Set the timeout for subsequent recv commands.

OUTPUT
------
Hex by default, but binary output may be requested with -b.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*nonzero*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error, file not found)

SEE ALSO
--------
*ccndstop*(1), *ccndstatus*(1)
