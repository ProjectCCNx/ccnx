NAME
----
ccnls - Attempts to list name components available at the next level of
the hierarchy for a given CCNx name prefix. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnls* 'ccnxname'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnls* utility lists name components available after the supplied CCNx
name prefix, 'ccnxname', for content objects that are cached in the local *ccnd*.

This utility does not have explicit flags or options, but can be modified via
environment variables.  These include the scope of the generated interest
('CCN_SCOPE'), the amount of time to wait between responses from *ccnd*
('CCN_LINGER') and whether signature verification is desired ('CCN_VERIFY').


OPTIONS
-------
The *ccnls* utility does not have additional flags or options.  Behavior can
be changed by using the following two environment variables.

    CCN_SCOPE=
      Scope in generated interests (0, 1, 2). The default is none specified.
      
    CCN_LINGER=
      Timeout for not receiving data.  The default is 0.5 seconds.
      
    CCN_VERIFY=
      If set and non-empty, indicates that signature verification is required.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; retrieval error)
