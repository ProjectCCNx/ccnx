DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ccndc* is a simple routing utility/daemon that configures the forwarding
table (FIB) in a *ccnd(1)*. It may be used either as a command to add
or delete static entries in the CCNx FIB (roughly analogous to
the *route(8)* utility for manipulating an IP routing table).
Where a face is specified it may either be by the parameters ('host', 'port', etc.)
or by face number.  Faces can be created or destroyed without reference to a
prefix, or will be created automatically if the parameters are given.
*ccndc* may also run as a daemon that will dynamically create Faces and FIB
entries to forward certain CCNx Interests based upon DNS SRV
records. The Interests that can be dynamically routed in this way are
those have an initial name component that is a legal DNS name, for
which there is a DNS SRV record pointing to an endpoint for tunneling
CCNx protocol traffic over the Internet.

*ccndc* also supports configuration files containing sets of commands.


OPTIONS
-------

*-d*:: 
       enter dynamic mode and create FIB entries based on DNS SRV records

*-f*:: 
       add or delete FIB entries based on contents of 'configfile'

*-t*:: 
       lifetime (seconds) of prefix entries created by subsequent operations
       including those created by dynamic mode and "srv" command.

*-v*:: 
       increase logging level

*add* 'uri' (*udp*|*tcp*) 'host' ['port' ['flags' ['mcastttl' ['mcastif']]]]::
      add a FIB entry based on the parameters, creating the face if necessary.

*renew* 'uri' (*udp*|*tcp*) 'host' ['port' ['flags' ['mcastttl' ['mcastif']]]]::
      destroy any matching face then recreate with the given parameters and
      add a FIB entry.

*add* 'uri' *face* 'faceid'::
      add a FIB entry to the specified face.
      
*del* 'uri' (*udp*|*tcp*) 'host' ['port' ['flags' ['mcastttl' ['mcastif']]]]::
      delete a FIB entry from the face specified by the parameters.

*del* 'uri' *face* 'faceid'::
      remove a FIB entry from the specified face number.

*create* (*udp*|*tcp*) 'host' ['port' ['mcastttl' ['mcastif']]]::
      create a face based on the parameters. No FIB entry is made.
      
*destroy* (*udp*|*tcp*) 'host' ['port' ['mcastttl' ['mcastif']]]::
      remove a face based on the parameters.

*destroy* *face* 'faceid'::

*destroyface* 'faceid'::
      destroy a face based on the numeric faceid.

*setstrategy* 'uri' 'strategy' ['parameters' ['lifetime']]::
    associate the named 'strategy' with the prefix 'uri'.
    The 'parameters' are passed along to the strategy;
    their interpretation is strategy-specific.
    Lifetime is in seconds.
    Note - lifetime is currently ignored by ccnd.

*getstrategy* 'uri'::
    get strategy information associated with the prefix 'uri',
    and print on standard output.  If no strategy has been
    associated the prefix, the inherited strategy and its
    prefix is printed instead.

*removestrategy* 'uri'::
    remove the strategy associated with the prefix 'uri'.
    output is the same as getstrategy.

*srv*::
      create a face and FIB entry (for ccnx:/) based on the results of an
      SRV lookup using the default DNS search rules.  Queries _ccnx._tcp and
      _ccnx._udp.

PREDEFINED STRATEGIES
---------------------

*default*::
	Prefers the fastest responding face, and performs experiments to determine if other
	faces can provide faster response.  This strategy also operates efficiently in environments
	where link quality changes or a face becomes unresponsive, but does not make use of
	multiple paths or sources.

*loadsharing*::
	Distributes Interests amongst the available faces based on the unanswered queue size.
	This strategy operates most efficiently when there are multiple physical interfaces
	and the network is the limiting performance factor.  Because it sends each interest to
	a single face, it is not recommended for chat-like or discovery applications,
	or in the presence of lossy links.

*parallel*::
	Sends Interests to all available faces in parallel.  This strategy attempts to mask
	unstable links or poorly performing faces by redundantly sending Interests.
	This increases the overall network load and local processing overhead, and is not
	recommended when the links are of high quality.

*trace*::
	Produces log output that is useful during the development of a new strategy.
	The first portion of the parameter string (before the first occurance of a slash)
        is the name of the traced strategy.  The remainder (after this slash) forms the
	traced strategy’s parameter string.


CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

*ccndc* will process a configuration file if specified with the *-f*
flag. The configuration file may contain a sequence of
commands with the same parameters as may be specified on the *ccndc*
command-line.  Comments in the file are prefixed with `#`.  Here is a
sample:

	 # Sample ccnd.conf for use with ccndc that will route all CCN URIs with
	 # an example.com prefix to a link-local multicast on an ephemeral port.
	 # 
	 add ccnx:/example.com/ udp 224.0.0.204 52428


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; communication error)
