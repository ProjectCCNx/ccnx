CCNPUTFILE(1)
=============

NAME
----
ccnputfile - publish a file as CCNx content

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnputfile* [-javaopts '<options>'] [-debug '<portno>'] [-v] [-raw] [-unversioned] [-local | -allownonlocal] [-timeout 'millis'] [-log 'LEVEL'] [-as 'pathToKeystore'] [-ac]  'ccnxname' 'filename|url'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnputfile* utility publishes a local file 'filename' or url 'url' as
content with the 'ccnxname'. The content is published as a collection of CCNx
Data in
accordance with the naming conventions for segmented streams or files,
optionally unversioned. For the default case of versioned content, *ccnputfile*
will publish content with the version based on the local machine time.

The 'ccnxname' must be specified using the CCNx URI encoding
syntax. For simple cases of ASCII name components this is just
pathname syntax with / delimiters.

The 'filename' must be the pathname of a local file that will published under
the 'ccnxname'.

The 'url' must be a valid url to be published under a 'ccnxname'.

*ccnputfile* will publish versioned and segmented content objects, and the key
used to sign them, to a repository by default. If the '-local' flag is used, a
local repository on the same device will be used.  If there is not a reachable
repository, *ccnputfile* will exit with a 'wait for put drain' error.  If
there is a corresponding application able to retrieve the content (e.x.
*ccngetfile*) *ccnputfile* can be used to publish the content with '-raw'. 
'-raw' allows *ccnputfile* to skip the repository handshake and directly put
the content objects to satisfy the *ccngetfile* interests.

*ccnputfile* can also be used to publish content with a specific key using
'-as' where 'pathToKeystore' must be a valid path to the local filesystem
where a user key has previously been stored.

*ccnputfile* can additionally be used with access control using the '-ac' flag.

OPTIONS
-------
*-v*::
     Run *ccnputfile* in verbose mode.

*-raw*::
     *ccnputfile* will publish the content objects without contacting a
     repository.  This mode will fail unless there is another application,
     such as *ccngetfile*, running.

*-unversioned*::
     Do not append a version component to the supplied 'ccnxname'. This option
     may be used when the supplied 'ccnxname' already includes an explicit
     version component at the end (which must be URI encoded). This option may
     also be used for content that is organized according to the
     segmentation convention but does not use the versioning
     convention at all. When this option is used, the FileOutputStream
     abstraction will not be used, since that implies versioning.

*-local*::
     Specifies that a local repository be used to save the file.
     This is the (new, as of release 0.5.0) default behavior.

*-allownonlocal*::
     Specifies that either a local or non-local repository be used to save the file.

*-timeout* 'millis'::
     Set the timeout that will be used for putting content objects on
     during the stream reading. I.e., the time to wait for incoming interests.

*-log* 'LEVEL'::
     Set the logging level. 'LEVEL' must be the an acceptable Java
     Logger level: either an integer or a level name (e.g. SEVERE).

*-as* 'pathToKeystore'::
     Set the user for signing published content.  This must point to a place
     in the filesystem where ccnx compatible keys have been saved.

*-ac*::
     This options forces *ccnputfile* to obey access control restrictions. The
     content is encrypted according to the access control list in force at the
     node where the content is stored.

*-debug* 'portno'::
	Allows attachment of an eclipse remote debugger to the utility at the specified port number.

*-javaopts* 'options'::
	Allows use of arbitrary java properties or options with the utility.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; publishing error - no processes running that are prepared to ask or already asking for content)
