CCNGETMETA(1)
=============

NAME
----
ccngetmeta - retrieve metadata associated with specified CCNx content and save 
it to a local file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccngetmeta* [-javaopts '<options>'] [-debug '<portno>'] [-unversioned] [-timeout 'millis'] [-as 'pathToKeystore'] [-ac]  'ccnxname' 'metaname' 'filename'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccngetmeta* utility retrieves metadata associated with content
'ccnxname' and writes it to the local file 'filename'. The metadata
must be published as a collection of CCNx Data in accordance with the
naming conventions for segmented streams or files, optionally
unversioned. For the default case of versioned content, *ccngetmeta*
will retrieve the latest version of the metadata associated with the
latest version of the referenced CCNx content.

The 'ccnxname' must be specified using the CCNx URI encoding
syntax. For simple cases of ASCII name components this is just
pathname syntax with / delimiters.

The 'metaname' must be the relative path of the metadata for the specified
ccnxname, for example '_thumbnail_/image'.

The 'filename' must be the pathname of a local file that will be
written and will be overwritten if it already exists.

The '-as' option sets the user key for decrypting published content.  This
must point to a place in the filesystem where CCNx compatible keys have been
saved.

The '-ac' flag forces *ccngetmeta* to obey access control restrictions.  If
the user is not permitted to read in a given namespace, decryption will fail.


OPTIONS
-------
*-unversioned*::
     Do not seek a version identifier as the next component following the
     'metaname' prefix in retrieved Data. This option may be used when the
     supplied 'metaname' already includes an explicit version
     component at the end (which must be URI encoded). This option may
     also be used for content that is organized according to the
     segmentation convention but does not use the versioning
     convention at all. When this option is used, the FileInputStream
     abstraction will not be used, since that implies versioning.

*-timeout* 'millis'::
     Set the timeout that will be used for all content retrievals on
     during the stream reading.

*-log* 'LEVEL'::
     Set the logging level. 'LEVEL' must be the an acceptable Java
     Logger level: either an integer or a level name (e.g. SEVERE).

*-as* 'pathToKeystore'::
     Set the user for decrypting published content.  This must point to a place
     in the filesystem where ccnx compatible keys have been saved.

*-ac*::
     This options forces *ccngetmeta* to obey access control restrictions.  If
     the user is not permitted to read in a given namespace, decryption will
     fail.

*-debug* 'portno'::
	Allows attachment of an eclipse remote debugger to the utility at the specified port number.

*-javaopts* 'options'::
	Allows use of arbitrary java properties or options with the utility.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; retrieval error)

EXAMPLE
-------
The following example retrieves the thumbnail metadata image.png associated 
with the latest version of ccnx content "ccnx:/mydocument" and places it into the file "checkimage.png"

    ccngetmeta "ccnx:/mydocument" "_thumbnail_/image.png" "checkimage.png"
