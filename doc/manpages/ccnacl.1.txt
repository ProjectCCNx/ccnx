CCNACL(1)

NAME
----
ccnacl - show and modify access control lists (ACLs) for
access control of a CCNx content namespace.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnacl* [-javaopts '<options>'] [-debug '<portno>'] [-as 'keystore'] -show 'nodeName'

*ccnacl* [-javaopts '<options>'] [-debug '<portno>'] [-as 'keystore'] -edit 'nodeName' 'principalName' [null | r | rw | rw+]

*ccnacl* [-javaopts '<options>'] [-debug '<portno>'] [-as 'keystore'] -init 'domain' 'userNamespace' 'groupNamespace' 'principalName'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnacl* utility prints or modifies an access control list (ACL)
published with CCNx. An ACL specifies who should have access to 
a particular collection, identified by the given 'nodeName'. Entities
that are supporting the CCNx access control profile will respect 
any ACL specification that applies to namespaces they are 
using.  Read control is achieved through encryption, so as long as the
writers support access control the readers must support it and be
authorized in order to read content.  Write control is achieved by
consumers rejecting content that is not published by an authorized
party. 

The 'nodeName' specifies the CCNx namespace in which the ACL is
published and to which it applies; CCNx Content Objects with
'nodeName' as a prefix of their names will be affected.
The 'nodeName' must be specified using the CCNx URI encoding
syntax. For simple cases of ASCII name components this is just
pathname syntax with / delimiters.

An ACL is published as immutable CCNx content.  When an ACL edit is
performed, new versions of the ACL and related keys are published.

OPTIONS
-------
*-as* 'pathToKeystore'::
	Specifies a file path to a keystore; this is used for signing any
        newly-created content.  Applicable to all operations.  The default
        keystore is used if this is not specified.

*-show* 'nodeName'::
	Print the contents of the ACL for the given 'nodeName'.

*-edit* 'nodeName' 'principalName' [null | r | rw | rw+]::
	Create an entry in the ACL of the given 'nodeName' to set the
	permissions for the given 'principalName' as specified. If the
	ACL does not exist it is created. The possible permissions are:

	* *null* = no access
	* *r* = Reader
	* *rw* = Writer, can also read
	* *rw+* = Manager, can read, write, and edit ACLs

*-init* 'domain' 'userNamespace' 'groupNamespace' 'principalName'::
	Initialises the authentication domain.

*-debug* 'portno'::
	Allows attachment of an eclipse remote debugger to the utility at the specified port number.

*-javaopts* 'options'::
	Allows use of arbitrary java properties or options with the utility.

*0*::
     Success

     Failure (syntax or usage error; retrieval error, failure to write)
