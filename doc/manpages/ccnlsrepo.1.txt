CCNLSREPO(1)
============

NAME
----
ccnlsrepo - explore content stored under a given prefix in one or more repositories.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnlsrepo* [-javaopts '<options>'] [-debug '<portno>'] 'ccnxname' [-timeout 'millis' | -c(ontinuous) ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnlsrepo* utility is a Java application used to explore content stored
under a given prefix ('ccnxname') in a repository.  Uses name enumeration to
limit responses to repositories and other NE responders.  The program defaults
to a prefix of "/" but takes a prefix as the first command-line argument.  The
tool displays names under the prefix after collecting names for a given time
period.  The initial default setting is 2 seconds.  To enumerate names for
more than 2 seconds (for example, if you have a long round trip time to a
repository or many responding repositories) the time can be extended using the
'-timeout' flag and the time to wait in milliseconds.  Another option is to
have a long running enumeration that outputs results as they are received at
the client.  This is triggered with the '-c' flag.

OPTIONS
-------
*-timeout* 'millis'::
	Enumerate names under the 'ccnxname' prefix from repositories for '-timeout' milliseconds.  The default is 2 seconds.

*-c* ::
	Allows for a long running enumeration that outputs responses from respositories as they are received.

*-debug* 'portno'::
	Allows attachment of an eclipse remote debugger to the utility at the specified port number.

*-javaopts* 'options'::
	Allows use of arbitrary java properties or options with the utility.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; enumeration error)
