CCNDLOGGING(1)
==============

NAME
----
ccndlogging - change the log level of a running ccnd

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccndlogging [-T host] ( none | low | co | med | high )*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccndlogging* utility changes the effective log level of a running *ccnd*.

OPTIONS
-------
*-T host*::
     Control the *ccnd* instance running on the specified host, instead of the current host.

ARGUMENT
--------
The command takes one argument, the desired level.
This maps into an appropriate setting of the effective *CCND_DEBUG* setting.
The levels are *none*, *low*, *co*, *med*, and *high*.
The *co* level shows content objects, but not interests (*CCND_DEBUG*=4);
the others should be self-explanatory.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
The 'CCN_LOCAL_PORT' environment variable may be used to identify
the port that the *ccnd* instance is using; if unset, the default
port number (9695) is used.
