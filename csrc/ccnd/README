ccndsmoketest - simple-minded program for exercising ccnd
	options: -t millisconds - sets the timeout for recv operations
		 -u hostname - communicate with ccnd using udp
	arguments: ( send <filename> | recv | kill | timeo <millisconds> ) ...
		send <filename> sends the literal contents of the file to the ccnd.
			The file should be in ccnd format.
		recv receives data from ccnd and dumps it to stdout.
			Subject to timeout.
		kill tries to get the ccnd to shut down.
		timeo <millisconds> changes the timeout for subsequent recvs.
	environment variables:
		CCN_LOCAL_PORT as for ccnd
