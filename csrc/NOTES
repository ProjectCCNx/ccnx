@subsection starting Getting Started 

For general instructions about how to install CCNx, please refer to
the top-level README file.

@subsection howitworks How the c build works 

The C build sticks as closely as possible to the common subset
of make(1) features, using the Posix specifications as a guide.

Since most (or all) make implementations have their own extensions, staying
within this subset is a continual challenge. The CCNx build is tested with
GNU make, BSD make, and Solaris make.

The ./configure script's main job is to build the conf.mk file that defines the
configurable make macros.  This is done largely just by using the
output of the uname command, but scripted configuration is possible as well.
The csrc/conf/ directory contains the system-specific make fragments and scripts.

If you need to override the configured values, put them into a file
named csrc/conf/local.mk before you execute ./configure in csrc/.

It is also possible to define certain environment variables
to modify default guesses of the ./configure script.
The most useful of these are:
- CFLAGS (default: -g)
- INSTALL_BASE (default: /usr/local)
- AR (default: leave unset to be supplied by make)
- CC (default: leave unset to be supplied by make)
- INSTALL (default: install)
- CP (default: cp)
- RM (default: rm -f)
- SH (default: /bin/sh)
- LS (default: /bin/ls)

For convenience, there is a Makefile link placed into the subdirectories of
csrc/ so that you can easily rebuild just part of the world.

@subsection installing The test and install targets 

After a successful make, you should do `make test` to check that things are 
working.  Then, if you wish, you can use `make install` to install into
/usr/local (or elsewhere if you have defined an override in local.mk).
Of course, the appropriate permissions are needed.

@subsection depend Dependencies 

The depend target (`make depend `) rebuilds the depend.mk files that capture
build dependencies.  This is not necessary when building from a release, because
a generic set of dependencies is included.  But if there have been modifications,
it is a good idea to run this before building.

the Content-Centric Networking in C Documentation.

If we want to refer to the directory ccn/csrc/cmd, with a link to the documentation for the
directory under that text, we would use (at)link cmd ccn/csrc/cmd (at)endlink (like this)
@link cmd ccn/csrc/cmd @endlink
as the reference.  Note that the single word following the (at)link command is the object
reference for the directory as doxygen believes it is named (see the Directories tab in the generated documentation)
