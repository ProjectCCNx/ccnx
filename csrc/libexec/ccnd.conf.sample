# Sample ccnd.conf for use with ccndc that will route all CCNx URIs with
# a /ccnx.org prefix using local multicast.
#
# The multicast address 224.0.23.170 is assigned by IANA for use with CCNx.
# Here we use a port that is different from the assigned port of 9695
# to reduce confusion, in case some hosts on the local network are using the
# latter for unicast traffic.  The port value 59695 is in the range for 
# ephermeral and private use.
# 
# add ccnx:/ccnx.org udp 224.0.23.170 59695
